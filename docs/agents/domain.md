# Domain Docs

**Layout: single-context.** This repo shares one vocabulary and one set of architecture decisions: a single `GLOSSARY.md` and a single `docs/adr/` at the repo root, used by every part of the project. There is no `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` and no per-subproject `GLOSSARY.md`; don't add them unless the repo genuinely splits into contexts that need their own vocabulary.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
